<blockquote>
<p>Stannis Baratheon was born in <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End">Storm&#39;s End</a> in 264 A.C. Stannis would be the younger brother of King Robert Baratheon and older brother to Renly Baratheon. As a child Stannis was a gloomy serious child. Stannis would seldom laugh. Stannis would lose his faith in the gods when he witnessed the death of his parents. Stannis would grow up to be a dutiful and serious man. Stannis would support his brother in Robert&#39;s Rebellion and endure a siege for almost a year at the hands of House Tyrell. Stannis and his men would be saved by the actions of <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_Seaworth">Davos Seaworth</a> and onion smuggler turned knight by Stannis. Stannis would survive the siege and seize <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone">Dragonstone</a> in 284 A.C. After the war Stannis would be given Dragonstone instead of Storm&#39;s End, a slight he would not soon forgive. Stannis would fight with distinction during the Greyjoy Rebellion as <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Master_of_ships">Master of Ships</a>. Stannis would grow suspicious of Cersei&#39;s children and would confine Jon Arryn about his suspicions. They would discover the truth shortly before Jon Arryn&#39;s death. Stannis would flee to Dragonstone and whilst there he would hear about the death of his brother and proclaim himself the One True King. Stannis would enjoy very little support and would have to compete with his brother <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon">Renly</a> for the support of the Storm Lords. Stannis would have to kill his brother Renly with magic via the red priestess <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre">Melisandre</a>. Stannis would attack King’s Landing with the support of the Storm Lords but fail to seize the capital during the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater">Battle of the Blackwater</a>. Stannis would flee to Dragonstone, then travel north to assist the Night’s Watch against the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Free_folk">Wildings</a>. Stannis’s pursuit of the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Throne">Iron Throne</a> is ongoing.
