<blockquote>
<p>Renly Baratheon was born in 277 A.C. at <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End">Storm’s End</a>. He was the youngest of the Baratheon brothers. Renly grew up to be a charming young man. Renly was said to be the spitting image of his older brother <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon">King Robert</a>. Renly was also rumored to be gay and in an affair with <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Loras_Tyrell">Loras Tyrell</a>. After the death of King Robert, Renly would marry <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Margaery_Tyrell">Margaery Tyrell</a> and rally the nobles of <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Reach">The Reach</a> and <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stormlands">The Stormlands</a> to his cause. Renly would confront his elder brother <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon">Stannis</a> at Storm’s End but would be killed by magic. Renly’s forces would split as most of the Reach men would go home whilst the Storm Lords would rally to Stannis. Renly is remembered as a gay, charming usurper.
