<blockquote>
<p>Robb Stark is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark">Catelyn Tully</a>. Robb was born in Riverrun in the waning days of Robert&#39;s Rebellion. Robb would grow up to be a skilled warrior, courteous and honorable boy. Robb was close to all his siblings and to his father&#39;s ward <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy">Theon Greyjoy</a>. After the jailing of his father, Robb Stark called the Banners of the North to march south to free his father. At <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Twins">The Twins</a>, Robb Stark would be forced to make a betrothal to a daughter to Lord <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Walder_Frey">Walder Frey</a> in order to cross the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Green_Fork">Green Fork</a> of the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trident">Trident</a> river. After crossing the Green Fork, Robb would hurry south to relieve the siege of Riverrun. At the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood">Battle of Whispering Wood</a>, Robb would capture and defeat Jaime Lannister. Shortly after Robb would rout the Lannisters at the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Camps">Battle of the Camps</a>. After Ned Stark is executed, Robb proclaims himself King of the North and the Trident. Robb makes peace envoys to King&#39;s Landing but is rejected. Robb also sends envoys to King Renly Baratheon but these fail as well. Robb ventures west into the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westerlands">Westerlands</a> defeating several Lannister armies. Robb would also seize many castles however, he is wounded during the storming of one. It is around this time that word of the fall of <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell">Winterfell</a> and the &quot;death&quot; of his younger brothers reach Robb. In a moment of despair Robb sleeps with Lady <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeyne_Westerling">Jeyne Westerling</a>. In order to preserve her honor he marries her. This severs ties with the Lord Walder Frey. Eventually ties with <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Karstark">House Karstark</a> are broken as well leading to Robb resorting to making peace with <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Frey">House Frey</a>. Walder Frey furious with Robb plots with Tywin Lannister and Lord <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Roose_Bolton">Roose Bolton</a> to kill Robb at the wedding of Robb&#39;s uncle Edmure to Walder&#39;s daughter Roslin. At the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Wedding">Red Wedding</a>Robb is killed alongside his mother. Roose Bolton assumes control of The North. Robb is remembered as a young, brave and brash King that was talented at war but terrible at politics.
